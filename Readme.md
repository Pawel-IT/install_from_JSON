# Install From JSON

This simple script will load the associated JSON file and execute the command from that JSON file. It will also check the local version (if local version exists) and only run the command if the version is different. Since there is no standard format for version numbers unforunately haven't programmed in anyway to detect if version is older or newer. Will only check if it's the same version or not.

I used it to quickly onboard various internal software onto our new PCs.
